# Shangqing Xu (徐尚青)

## Bio

I'm a second-year Master's student of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. My main research interest lies in the application of large-scale machine learning methods, including LLM, pre-trained graph models, etc. Currently, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant following Prof. [Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org). 

Before joining Tech, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/). 

I'm actively seeking Ph.D. chances in Fall 2024. Please check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jozNuglyS4b8L970kuwvelUjSZBm9yHo/view?usp=share_link) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shangqing-xu-08735a258/) if you are interested in me!

## Misc

If you are interested in how my name is pronounced in Chinese, it sounds like 'Shawn-Chin Shoo'.

I'm especially interested in reading novels. My favorites are *Le Comte de Monte-Cristo* and the *Foundation* series. Visual novel games are also of my preferences, among which I enjoy *Steins; Gate* and *13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim* the most.
