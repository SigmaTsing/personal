# Shangqing Xu (徐尚青)

## Bio

I'm a first-year PhD student of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). I also work closely with Prof. [Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org). Previous to my PhD study, I obtained my Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. Before joining Tech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. In Tsinghua, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Wentao Han](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~hanwentao/), Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) and Prof. [Dan Pei](https://netman.aiops.org/~peidan/). 

My ultimate research goal is to build **self-evolving AI** that can serve as active learner and make interactions with human and real world efficiently. My primary research focuses on **machine learning** and real-world **NLP** tasks:

- **Data-efficient ML with self-supervision**, [ML4H 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v225/xu23a/xu23a.pdf)
- **Large language models (LLMs) with external guidance**, [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06301)
- **Multi-modal time-series models**, [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627)
- **ML theory**, [IJCNN 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207493)

I'm actively seeking full-time intership chances in Summer 2025. Please check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jozNuglyS4b8L970kuwvelUjSZBm9yHo/view?usp=share_link) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shangqing-xu-08735a258/) if you are interested in me!

## Misc

If you are interested in how my name is pronounced in Chinese, it sounds like 'Shawn-Chin Shoo'.

I'm especially interested in reading novels. My favorites are *Le Comte de Monte-Cristo* and the *Foundation* series (which contributes to my research interest fairly a lot). Visual novel games are also of my preferences, among which I enjoy *Steins; Gate* and *13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim* the most.
